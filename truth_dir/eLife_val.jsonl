{"lay_summary": "In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer \u2013 mainly due to injuries \u2013 than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February \u2013 largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help .", "article": "In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women \u2265 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ram\u00f3n and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study\u2019s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9\u00b0C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5\u00b0C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6\u00b0C , 8 . 0\u00b0C , 8 . 2\u00b0C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5\u00b0C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( \u22126 . 5\u00b0C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10\u00b0C to 14\u00b0C ) and variation within the year of ( 23\u00b0C to 26\u00b0C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0\u20134 , 5\u201314 , 15-24 , 25\u201334 , 35\u201344 , 45\u201354 , 55\u201364 , 65\u201374 , 75\u201384 , 85+\u00a0years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month\u2019s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980\u20132016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and \u22121 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year\u2019s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( \u03b8- ) of the angles ( \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83\u2026 , \u03b8n , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:\u03b8-=arg\u2211j=1nexp\u2061 ( i\u03b8j ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and \u03b8j denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death ."}
{"lay_summary": "The brain adapts to control our behavior in different ways depending on the specific situation , which is particularly useful when deciding how to interpret conflicting sets of information . The 'Stroop task' is a classic demonstration of this process . In this task , individuals are shown words where the color and the meaning of the text conflict \u2013 for example , the word 'green' is written in blue . When asked what the color of the text is , individuals must suppress the instinct to read the word . This causes them to make more mistakes and take longer to decide on an answer than when they perform the same task using words that have no conflict ( for example , when \u201cred\u201d is written in red ) . Previous work has suggested that several regions within part of the brain called the frontal cortex play a role in this cognitive control process . However , the relative contributions of each of these regions , and the order in which they are activated , remain unclear . This is in part due to the fact that accurately measuring the electrical activity of the frontal cortex requires implanting electrodes into the brain . Tang et al . took advantage of a rare opportunity to record this activity from a group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their frontal cortex to treat epilepsy . The electrical signals recorded by these electrodes as the subjects performed the Stroop task revealed that four regions in the frontal cortex altered their activity during trials where the color and the meaning of a word conflicted . These responses corresponded with the subject\u2019s reaction time , changed depending on the exact nature of the task , and even reflected the subjects\u2019 errors . These responses arose at different times in different regions , allowing Tang et al . to suggest how signals flow through the frontal cortex during cognitive control . In the future it will be important to further understand how the regions of the frontal cortex identified by Tang et al . interact with each other and to establish their roles in cognitive control . These observations could then be used to produce a theoretical framework that describes how the brain adapts behavior to different circumstances .", "article": "Rapid and flexible interpretation of conflicting sensory inputs in the context of current goals is a critical component of cognitive control that is orchestrated by frontal cortex . The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood . To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions , we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict . We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times . These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) , followed by medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) and then by orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics , and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex . \n Flexible control of cognitive processes is fundamental to daily activities , including the execution of goal-directed tasks according to stimulus inputs and context dependencies . An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal ( e . g . the word 'red' shown in green versus red ) . Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times , attributed to weaker signals ( color processing ) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information ( Stroop , 1935 ) . The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control . Neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) , yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood . Lesion studies ( Cohen and Servan-Schreiber , 1992; Perrett , 1974 ) , human neuroimaging measurements ( Egner and Hirsch , 2005a; MacDonald , 2000 ) , and macaque single unit recordings ( Johnston et al . , 2007 ) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . The medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) also participates in cognitive control , possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ( Ito et al . , 2003; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments ( Brown and Braver , 2005; Ito et al . , 2003; Johnston et al . , 2007; Roth\u00e9 et al . , 2011 ) \u2014an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) . An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006; Kerns et al . , 2004; MacDonald , 2000 ) but the relative contributions of dlPFC , mFC , and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate ( Aarts et al . , 2008; Cole et al . , 2009; Fellows and Farah , 2005; Mansouri et al . , 2007; Milham and Banich , 2005; Milham et al . , 2003; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Previously , some neuroimaging studies have suggested that these frontal cortex regions can be differentiated based on the presence or absence of conflict signals ( MacDonald , 2000 ) . The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions ( attention , decision-making , uncertainty , cognitive control ) . These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques ( Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control . We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses . We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color . We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC , mFC , dlPFC , and also orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control . Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials , and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time , depended on the task , and exhibited adaptation over trials . We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence . Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC . These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control . \n We focused on 469 electrodes located in areas within frontal lobe which have been previously implicated in executive function: medial frontal cortex ( mFC , n = 111 ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC , n = 156 ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC , n = 168 ) and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC , n = 34 ) . We applied a non-parametric analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to measure whether and when the physiological responses differed between congruent and incongruent trials . An electrode was considered conflict-selective if the F-statistic was greater than a significance threshold computed by a permutation test with P = 0 . 001 for 50 consecutive milliseconds ( Materials and methods ) . The latency was defined as the first time of this threshold-crossing . Figure 2 shows an example electrode from the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex that responded differentially between congruent and incongruent trials during the Stroop task . These signals were better aligned to the speech onset than to the stimulus onset , as shown in the response-aligned view ( compare Figure 2A\u2013C with Figure 2D\u2013F ) . During the Stroop task , the response-aligned signals were significantly stronger for the incongruent ( brown ) trials compared to the congruent ( black ) trials ( Figure 2D , P < 10\u20135 , ANOVA ) , and were invariant to the particular word/color combinations ( Figure 2G ) . Incongruent trials could be discriminated from congruent trials at a latency of 669 \u00b1 31 ms ( mean \u00b1 s . e . m . ) before the onset of the response ( Figure 2D ) . This conflict response was also specific to the Stroop task; there was a significant interaction between congruency and task ( F = 13 . 5 , P = 0 . 007 , ANOVA ) . The same stimuli did not elicit differential activity during the Reading task ( Figure 2F ) . We assessed the correlation between the neural signal strength and behavioral reaction times in single trials . The maximal gamma power during each incongruent trial ( using the average gamma power yielded similar results ) was positively correlated with the behavioral reaction times ( Figure 2H , \u03c1 = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 02 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 006Figure 2 .

More example electrodes are shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ( dlPFC ) and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ( OFC ) . Using the aforementioned criteria , we identified n = 51 conflict selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Stroop task , with contributions from 13 subjects ( Supplementary files 2 and 3 ) . These electrodes were distributed throughout different subregions within frontal cortex ( Figure 3A ) . To evaluate whether random variation in the signals could give rise to apparent conflict-selective electrodes , we randomly shuffled the congruent/incongruent trial labels 10 , 000 times and applied the same statistical criteria ( Materials and methods ) . Across our population , we found n = 4 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 03 false positive electrodes ( mean \u00b1 s . e . m . , out of 469 electrodes ) , which corresponds to a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of q = 0 . 01 , which is significantly less than our observation of n = 51 electrodes . The number of conflict-selective electrodes within each subregion was significantly greater than expected by chance ( Figure 3B , P < 0 . 01 , all regions ) . We repeated the analyses during the Reading task .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 011 To account for within-subject and across-subject variation , we used a multilevel model ( Aarts et al . , 2014 ) to conduct a group analysis of the physiological responses , with electrodes nested within subjects ( Materials and methods ) . Across the population , we observed a significant interaction between the factors congruency and task on the gamma power ( \u03c72=9 . 2 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Consistent with the single electrode examples , gamma power was greater for incongruent compared to congruent trials , but only during the Stroop task ( Figure 4A , Stroop: P < 10\u20133 , Reading: P = 0 . 56 ) . We computed the average response in each region ( Figure 4B ) . Each electrode\u2019s response was normalized by dividing the power during incongruent trials by the power in congruent trials ( dividing the brown curve by the black curve in Figure 2 ) , computing the logarithm and finally pooling within each region . The pooled responses in the OFC are visually less compelling ( Figure 4B , bottom right subplot ) due to the heterogeneity in the latency of the individual electrodes but the responses in the OFC were as vigorous as the ones in other areas ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Similar conclusions were reached when plotting the pooled responses aligned to stimulus onset ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 016 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a link between the neural signals described in the previous section and cognitive control: the neural signals correlated with reaction times , showed behavioral adaptation , and demonstrated error monitoring . As shown in previous studies , there was a wide distribution of behavioral reaction times ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with the example electrode in Figure 2 , behavioral reaction times across the population correlated with the strength of the physiological signals , even after controlling for trial history ( Figure 4C , P < 10\u20135 , sign-rank test ) . The strength of these neural signals also revealed a neural correlate of the behavioral Gratton effect documented in Figure 1D: gamma power was greater in cI compared to iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . Using the aforementioned multilevel model , we found a significant interaction between trial history ( cI or iI ) and task ( \u03c72=4 . 4 , P = 0 . 03 ) . This Gratton effect was stronger in the Stroop task ( P < 0 . 001 ) than in the Reading task ( P = 0 . 72 ) . These differences were not observed for cC versus iC trials , where the interaction was not significant ( \u03c72=1 . 9 , P = 0 . 17 ) ( Figure 4E ) . This analysis was performed after removing stimulus repetition trials . The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions ( F = 0 . 25 , P\u00a0=\u00a00 . 86 , ANOVA ) . To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons , we ran an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate ( Materials and methods ) . The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions ( P = 0 . 0002 , multilevel model ) . We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions , with similar results ( P = 0 . 01 , multilevel model ) . Together , these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times . The results presented above focus on the neural signals filtered within the gamma frequency band ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) . We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals ( 1 to 100\u2009Hz ) as well as in the theta , ( 4 to 8\u2009Hz ) , beta , ( 9 to 30\u2009Hz ) , and low gamma ( 30\u201370\u2009Hz ) bands . No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band . We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands ( see example in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013f ) . Across theta and beta frequency bands , we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task ( theta: P < 10\u20135 , beta: P < 10\u20134 , multilevel model ) . Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band , conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast to the results in the gamma band , power in the theta and beta bands decreased during incongruent trials . Furthermore , power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times ( theta: P = 0 . 43 , beta: P = 0 . 09 , sign-rank test ) . In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands , an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band ( Canolty et al . , 2006; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Tort et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Consistent with previous studies , we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling . However , the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes ( P = 0 . 52 , sign-rank test ) . The conflict responses reported above are based on correct trials only . Yet , error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits ( Bonini et al . , 2014; Shenhav et al . , 2013; Yeung et al . , 2004 ) . To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring , we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials . In these trials , subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer . Given the high performance level of all subjects , the number of such trials is low . However , these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection ( as opposed to error trials without any self-correction ) . An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in Figure 5A . The subject initially made an incorrect response ( green ) , which was rapidly followed with the correct response ( red ) . Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response . In contrast , the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal . Additionally , these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials ( Figure 2D ) , and were consistent across the n =\u00a011 self-corrected trials for this subject ( Figure 5B , P = 0 . 001 , signed rank test ) . Another example electrode is shown in Figure 5C\u2013D . There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials ( greater than five trials ) for this analysis . For each electrode , we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction . Of those n = 7 electrodes , n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring ( Figure 5E , P < 0 . 05 , sign-rank test ) . Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small , these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals . Furthermore , these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 017Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 018 We observed conflict-selective responses in the anterior cingulate cortex , medial frontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex . To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs , we compared , across those four regional groups , the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated . Comparing latencies across regions is difficult , especially across subjects with varying reaction times . For a controlled and direct comparison , we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas ( Figure 6 ) . The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions ( P = 0 . 01 , permutation test , post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure , Materials and methods ) . Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions , followed 207 \u00b1 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 \u00b1 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex . Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 \u00b1 78 ms after dlPFC . This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms . For comparison , subjects\u2019 behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 \u00b1 49 ms . The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes . There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in Figure 6 . The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects ( Supplementary file 3 ) . These results suggest a temporal hierarchy of cognitive control mechanisms culminating in speech onset . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 019Figure 6 . Latency Comparisons across regions . Latency differences between different regions computed from all pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . np denotes the number of electrode pairs . Because we only consider simultaneously recorded electrodes here , not all the electrodes modulated by conflict can be paired with any other electrode . Supplementary file 3 shows the number of electrodes modulated by conflict in each area and subject . There was only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and therefore we do not show the latency difference between these two regions here . Significant latency differences ( P < 0 . 05 , permutation test , Materials and methods ) are shown in black , and non-significant differences in gray . ACC leads both mFC ( P = 0 . 001 ) and dlPFC ( P = 0 . 02 ) , with OFC following dlPFC ( P = 0 . 009 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 020 \n We used intracranial field potentials to measure the dynamics of conflict responses across frontal cortex leading up to the behavioral response in the Stroop task . Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kolling et al . , 2012; MacDonald , 2000; Niendam et al . , 2012; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC ( e . g . Figure 2 ) , dlPFC ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , mFC ( e . g . Figure 4B ) and OFC ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The mFC and dlPFC have been previously implicated in cognitive control , and these structures are extensively connected to the rest of frontal cortex areas ( Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . The role of the OFC in cognitive control during Stroop-like tasks has not been reported previously , possibly because of technical challenges in neuroimaging near this area ( Weiskopf et al . , 2006 ) . We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task . Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task , even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli ( Figure 2H , 4C ) . The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured , at least partly , by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial . The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation ( Gratton effect\u00a0[Gratton et al . , 1992] ) were observed in the ACC , consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) , neuroimaging ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006 ) and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect , suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized . The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials ( incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials ) than iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 ) , single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship ( iI > cI ) ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation . Another discrepancy between neuroimaging studies and single unit recordings is the presence of conflict responses and error signals . Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses ( Cole et al . , 2009; Emeric et al . , 2010; Ito et al . , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2006 ) , see however ( Ebitz and Platt , 2015 ) , whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC . There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes ( Carter et al . , 1998; Carter et al . , 2000; Nee et al . , 2011; Swick and Turken , 2002 ) . Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials , high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations . A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) , and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals . The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals ( Figure 5 ) . In addition , the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict ( Yeung et al . , 2004 ) and scalp EEG studies ( Hughes and Yeung , 2011 ) . These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction , of which conflict and error detection are special cases ( Brown and Braver , 2005 ) . It has been suggested that ACC and supplementary eye field neurons in macaque monkeys respond to specific stimulus and/or behavioral combinations but are not directly modulated by conflict ( Cole et al . , 2009; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) . At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here , the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses ( e . g . Figure 2G ) and were also task dependent ( compare Figure 2A versus 2C ) . In these patients , we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level . Besides the high gamma band , we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands , but not the low gamma band ( e . g . Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Kahana et al . , 2001; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) . There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components . Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior . Additionally , conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band , but decreased power in the theta and beta bands ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Previous scalp EEG recordings ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; van Driel et al . , 2015 ) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power , suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales . We also observed a decrease in beta power , which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands ( Crone et al . , 1998a; Crone et al . , 1998b ) . Differences across tasks , recording methods , and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution . The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood . One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population ( Logothetis et al . , 2001; Mitzdorf , 1987 ) and can act as channels for communication ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014 ) , whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate ( Buzsaki et al . , 2012; Ray and Maunsell , 2011 ) . Along these lines , we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs , leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response . While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex , the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset . By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes , we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms . Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC , and the two regions are often grouped together ( Cavanagh et al . , 2009; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . Yet , conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds , suggesting an important distinction between the two regions ( Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade . The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control ( e . g . see Figure 2 in Shenhav et al , Neuron 2013 ) . In particular , stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex , where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions , followed by dlPFC , and finally mFC , and OFC . Since the local field potential pools over many neurons , latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors , such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization . Yet , at least in the ACC , the temporal profile of conflict responses we observed is similar to responses from human single unit recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing . There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet , it takes 100\u2013200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas ( Figure 6 ) . Daily decisions require integration of different goals , contexts , input signals , and the consequences of the resulting actions . The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles . The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control , and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex . \n Subjects were 15 patients ( 10 male , Ages 10\u201350 , Supplementary file 1 ) with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston ( CHB ) , Johns Hopkins Medical Institution ( JHMI ) , Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital ( BWH ) , or Taipei Veterans General Hospital ( TVGH ) . These subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes in frontal cortex for clinical purposes . Five other subjects participated in this task but they were excluded from the analyses because they did not have any electrodes in frontal cortex . All studies were approved by each hospital\u2019s institutional review boards and were carried out with the subjects\u2019 informed consent . Subjects were implanted with 2\u00a0mm diameter intracranial subdural electrodes ( Ad-Tech , Racine , WI , USA ) that were arranged into grids or strips with 1 cm separation . Electrode locations were determined by clinical considerations . There were 1397 electrodes ( 15 subjects ) . Sampling rates ranged from 256\u2009Hz to 1000\u2009Hz depending on the equipment at each institution: CHB ( XLTEK , Oakville , ON , Canada ) , BWH ( Bio-Logic , Knoxville , TN , USA ) , JHMI ( Nihon Kohden , Tokyo , Japan ) , and TVGH ( Natus , San Carlos , CA ) . All the data were collected during periods without any seizure events or immediately\u00a0following any seizures . A schematic of the task is shown in Figure 1 . After 500 ms of fixation , subjects were presented with a word stimulus for 2 s . The stimulus presentation was 3 s in two subjects . Stimuli were one of three words ( Red , Blue , Green ) presented in the subjects\u2019 primary language ( CHB , BWH , JHMI: English; TVGH: Mandarin ) either in red , blue , or green font color . Stimuli subtended approximately 5 degrees of visual angle and were centered on the screen . Trials were either congruent ( C ) , where the font color matched the word , or incongruent ( I ) , where the font color conflicted with the word . The order of congruent and incongruent trials was randomized . Approximately 40% of the trials were incongruent trials . Within congruent trials and within incongruent trials all color-word combinations were counter balanced and randomly interleaved . Subjects were asked to either name the color ( Stroop task ) or read the word ( Reading task ) within the time limit imposed by the stimulus presentation time . Each block contained 18 trials , and the two tasks were completed in separate blocks . Most subjects completed 18 blocks of the Stroop task and 9 blocks of the Reading task ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Audio was recorded using a microphone at 8192\u2009Hz sampling rate . No correct/incorrect feedback was provided . Electrodes were localized by co-registering the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) with the postoperative computer tomography ( CT ) ( Destrieux et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In 4 subjects without a postoperative CT , electrodes were localized using intraoperative photographs and preoperative MRI . For each subject , the brain surface was reconstructed from the MRI and then assigned to one of 75 regions by Freesurfer . Depth electrodes were assigned to either a subcortical structure or to gyri/sulci . We focused on those electrodes in four frontal cortex regions ( ACC: anterior and middle-anterior cingulate gyrus , mFC: superior frontal gyrus , dlPFC: middle frontal gyrus , and OFC: orbitofrontal gyrus ) . To determine the behavioral reaction time for each trial , the short-time energy was computed from the audio recordings . For an audio signal x ( t ) , the short-time energy E ( t ) is defined as: E ( t ) =\u2211m=0m=T[x ( m ) w ( t\u2212m ) ]2 , where T is the length of the recording and w ( t ) is a 300-point Hamming window ( ~40 ms ) . Speech onset was defined as the first time when the energy crossed a threshold set as 1 standard deviation above the baseline . Only trials where the subject gave a single verbal response and the speech onset could be identified were considered correct trials . Unless otherwise noted , analyses in this manuscript used correct trials only . Electrodes with significant spectral noise were excluded from analysis ( n = 25 out of 1397 total electrodes ) . For each electrode , a notch filter was applied at 60\u2009Hz , and the common average reference computed from all channels was subtracted . Power in the theta ( 4\u20138\u2009Hz ) , beta ( 9\u201330\u2009Hz ) , and high-gamma band ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) was extracted using a moving window multi-taper Fourier transform ( Chronux toolbox [Mitra and Bokil , 2008] ) with a time-bandwidth product of five and seven tapers . The window size was 200 ms with 10 ms increments . In several figures , the gamma power was z-scored for display purposes ( see figure legends ) . To determine whether and when an electrode responded selectively to conflict , we used a sliding F-statistic procedure ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Electrodes with differential responses between congruent and incongruent trials were selected by computing the F-statistic , for each time bin , comparing the neural responses between congruent and incongruent trials . Electrodes were denoted as \u2018conflict selective\u2019 if ( 1 ) the F-statistic exceeded a significance threshold for 50 consecutive milliseconds , and ( 2 ) the average neural response exceeded one standard deviation above the baseline period at least once during the trial . A null distribution generated by randomly permuting the labels was used to set the significance threshold with P\u00a0=\u00a00 . 001 . The latency at which congruent and incongruent stimuli could be discriminated was defined as the first time of this threshold crossing . For the response-aligned view , only electrodes where the latency preceded the response were included in subsequent analysis . This selection process was independently performed for each electrode in both stimulus-aligned and response-aligned analyses , and separately for the Stroop and Reading task . We used a permutation test with 10 , 000 shuffles to obtain a false discovery rate for our selection process . The congruent/incongruent trial labels were randomized 10 , 000 times and we measured the average number of electrodes across our population that passed the selection procedure . For the selected electrodes obtained with the procedure described in the previous section , we performed a number of within-electrode analyses . We measured single-trial correlations with behavioral reaction times , assessed the significance of interactions and simple/main effects , and controlled for confounds in measuring the neural Gratton effect . To account for both within-subject and across-subject variance , statistical testing of the electrophysiological data was conducted with multilevel models ( Aarts et al . , 2014; Goldstein , 2011 ) ( also known as random effect models ) . Random factors included electrodes nested within subjects . Significance of interactions and/or main effects was assessed with a likelihood ratio test against a null model excluding that particular term . For comparison of latency across regions , we restricted our analyses to simultaneous measurements made within each subject . We computed the latency difference for each pair of simultaneously recorded electrodes from different regions . The F-statistic of this latency difference across the groups was compared against a null distribution generated by shuffling , within each subject , the region labels ( n = 10 , 000 shuffles ) . Post hoc testing used the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons . To measure cross-frequency coupling between the theta and gamma frequency bands , we used the Modulation Index ( MI ) defined previously ( Tort et al . , 2008 ) . Activity in the theta ( 4\u20138\u2009Hz ) and high gamma ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) bands was obtained with a zero-phase least-squares finite impulse response ( FIR ) filter . Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform . For the Stroop and Reading Task separately , the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution . For comparison between tasks , the number of trials was equalized . This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions . Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al . ( Canolty et al . , 2006 ) . Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials . To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions , we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count . This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels ."}
{"lay_summary": "In the kidney , structures known as nephrons are responsible for collecting metabolic waste . Nephrons are composed of a blood filter ( glomerulus ) followed by a series of specialized tubule regions , or segments , which recover solutes such as salts , and finally terminate with a collecting duct . The genetic mechanisms that establish nephron segmentation in mammals have been a challenge to study because of the kidney's complex organogenesis . The zebrafish embryonic kidney ( pronephros ) contains two nephrons , previously thought to consist of a glomerulus , short tubule , and long stretch of duct . In this study , we have redefined the anatomy of the zebrafish pronephros and shown that the duct is actually subdivided into distinct tubule segments that are analogous to the proximal and distal segments found in mammalian nephrons . Next , we used the zebrafish pronephros to investigate how nephron segmentation occurs . We found that retinoic acid ( RA ) induces proximal pronephros segments and represses distal segment fates . Further , we found that the caudal ( cdx ) transcription factors direct the anteroposterior location of pronephric progenitors by regulating the site of RA production . Taken together , these results reveal that a cdx-RA pathway plays a key role in both establishing where the pronephros forms along the embryonic axis as well as its segmentation pattern .", "article": "Kidney function depends on the nephron , which comprises a blood filter , a tubule that is subdivided into functionally distinct segments , and a collecting duct . How these regions arise during development is poorly understood . The zebrafish pronephros consists of two linear nephrons that develop from the intermediate mesoderm along the length of the trunk . Here we show that , contrary to current dogma , these nephrons possess multiple proximal and distal tubule domains that resemble the organization of the mammalian nephron . We examined whether pronephric segmentation is mediated by retinoic acid ( RA ) and the caudal ( cdx ) transcription factors , which are known regulators of segmental identity during development . Inhibition of RA signaling resulted in a loss of the proximal segments and an expansion of the distal segments , while exogenous RA treatment induced proximal segment fates at the expense of distal fates . Loss of cdx function caused abrogation of distal segments , a posterior shift in the position of the pronephros , and alterations in the expression boundaries of raldh2 and cyp26a1 , which encode enzymes that synthesize and degrade RA , respectively . These results suggest that the cdx genes act to localize the activity of RA along the axis , thereby determining where the pronephros forms . Consistent with this , the pronephric-positioning defect and the loss of distal tubule fate were rescued in embryos doubly-deficient for cdx and RA . These findings reveal a novel link between the RA and cdx pathways and provide a model for how pronephric nephrons are segmented and positioned along the embryonic axis . \n The kidney eliminates metabolic waste in the body using highly specialized structures called nephrons . Individual nephrons are composed of a blood filter ( renal corpuscle ) , a tubule that recovers or secretes solutes , and a collecting duct [1] . The renal corpuscle contains epithelial cells called podocytes that form the slit-diaphragm filtration barrier and allow collection of substances from the blood [2] . In a number of vertebrate species , including some mammals , the renal corpuscle is connected to the tubule by a short stretch of ciliated epithelium called the neck segment that guides filtrate entry into the tubule [3\u20135] . The mammalian nephron tubule is subdivided into a series of proximal and distal segments connected to a collecting duct [1 , 6] . The polarized epithelial cells in the tubule segments have a unique ultrastructure and express a select cohort of solute transporters [1] . Thus , each segment is functionally distinct and performs the transport of particular solutes that are required for proper renal function . In higher vertebrates , three kidneys of increasing complexity arise sequentially from the intermediate mesoderm ( IM ) : the pronephros , the mesonephros , and the metanephros [7] . The pronephros and mesonephros degenerate in succession , with the metanephros serving as the adult kidney . Lower vertebrates , such as fish and amphibians , develop a pronephros during embryonic stages , and then form a mesonephros that will be used throughout their adult life [8\u201310] . Each of these kidneys contains the nephron as its basic functional unit [8] . To date , much of our knowledge of kidney development has come from gene-targeting studies in the mouse [7 , 11 , 12] . These experiments have identified a number of genes that play essential roles in the early stages of metanephros development , but there is a limited understanding of the molecular pathways governing the later stages of kidney ontogeny , when individual nephrons form and become segmented [7] . The zebrafish is an ideal genetic and developmental model system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of nephron formation because of the anatomical simplicity of the pronephros , which contains two nephrons as opposed to the thousands of nephrons in a mammalian metanephros [9] . During zebrafish development , bilateral stripes of IM lying on either side of the trunk undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to form the pair of pronephric nephrons . The anteriormost renal progenitors differentiate into podocytes , which migrate medially and fuse at the midline to form a single renal corpuscle . The nephrons also fuse posteriorly at the cloaca to form a shared exitway . From a functional standpoint , these pronephric nephrons have been thought to consist of three parts: ( 1 ) the blood-filtering renal corpuscle , ( 2 ) a very short tubule region that transports solutes , and ( 3 ) long pronephric ducts that convey the resulting waste to the cloaca [9] . Contrary to this model , recent studies have suggested that the \u2018duct' region possesses regional segmentation , based on the restricted expression boundaries of solute transporter orthologues known to be expressed in the tubule segments of metanephric nephrons . For example , a rostral stretch of the pronephric duct expresses the endocytic receptor megalin ( lrp2 ) [13] and the sodium bicarbonate transporter NBC1 ( slc4a4 ) [14] , which are expressed in the proximal tubule in mammals . These reports raise the possibility that portions of the pronephros considered to be duct might in fact be tubule , thus suggesting that the organization of the zebrafish pronephros is more complex than previously appreciated . However , a complete model of the molecular anatomy of the zebrafish pronephros and whether there is a functional correlation to the segments of the mammalian nephron remain unclear . Furthermore , the pathway ( s ) directing segmentation of the pronephros along the embryonic axis are unknown . Numerous factors are known to control segmental patterning along the anterior-posterior ( A-P ) axis during vertebrate development and thus provide candidate pathways that might act to establish pronephros segmentation . Retinoic acid ( RA ) signaling is vital for directing the A-P regionalization of tissues deriving from all three germ layers , such as the hindbrain , paraxial mesoderm , and gut [15\u201319] . Control of RA production via retinaldehyde dehydrogenase ( RALDH ) synthesizing enzymes [20] and the degradation of RA via the CYP26 catabolizing enzymes establishes both the location and timing of RA signaling [21 , 22] . In addition to RA , the caudal ( cdx ) transcription factors ( Cdx1 , Cdx2 , and Cdx4 in mammals and cdx1a and cdx4 in zebrafish ) are responsible for determining vertebral identity and directing posterior body formation [23\u201331] . cdx genes are known to act as master regulators of the homeobox ( hox ) transcription factors [25] , and in turn , overlapping domains of hox gene expression along the A-P axis are thought to confer segmental identities [32] . In mice , loss of Cdx function causes posterior shifts in Hox gene expression that are associated with abnormal vertebral patterning , and posterior truncations due to defects in the extension of the embryo axis [23 , 25\u201327 , 33] . Similarly , studies in zebrafish have shown that the loss of cdx4 function or deficiency of both cdx1a and cdx4 causes shifts in hox gene expression domains , a shortened body axis , and altered patterning of the blood , vascular , and neural tissues [24 , 28\u201331] . These lines of evidence indicate that the cdx genes play essential roles in controlling cell fates along the embryonic axis; however , the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated [34] . In this study , we undertook a functional genomics approach to identify new markers of the zebrafish pronephros . From this analysis , we found that the pronephros is composed of at least eight regions , including two proximal and two distal tubule segments . We explored how segmental identity is controlled during nephrogenesis by testing the roles of RA signaling and the cdx genes . We found that RA is required to induce proximal segment fates and prevent the expansion of distal segment fates , whereas the cdx genes are necessary for positioning the pronephros along the embryonic axis . Embryos deficient in cdx1a and cdx4 displayed a posterior shift in the location of the pronephros and formed proximal but not distal nephron segments . The cdx genes were found to control the expression boundaries of raldh2 ( aldh1a2 ) and cyp26a1 , suggesting a model in which the cdx pathway influences where the pronephros forms along the body axis by localizing the source of RA , while subsequent RA signaling acts to direct the segmentation of the pronephros . \n To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that control vertebrate renal development , we undertook a functional genomics approach to identify genes expressed in the kidney . We mined two gene collections , one comprising developmentally expressed genes from embryonic zebrafish cDNA libraries [35] and another compiled from an adult zebrafish kidney library [36] . Gene expression patterns were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization using wild-type zebrafish embryos between the 5 somite stage and 144 hours post fertilization ( hpf ) . We identified a number of genes , including 15 solute transporters , that were expressed within specific subregions of the pronephros . In total , eight distinct regions could be visualized , with some genes expressed in more than one region ( Figure 1A ) . Representative examples of region-specific genes include wt1b , slc20a1a , trpm7 , slc12a1 , stc1 , slc12a3 , and gata3 , as compared to expression of cdh17 , which is found in all tubule and duct progenitors [37] ( Figure 1A ) . We investigated where the mouse or human orthologues of some of these genes are expressed in the mammalian metanephric kidney , and found that many corresponded to segment-specific domains within the nephron . For example , Slc9a3 is expressed in podocytes , the proximal convoluted segment ( PCT ) and proximal straight segment ( PST ) ( Figure 1B ) [38] . Slc20a1 is expressed throughout the entire nephron epithelium , although stronger expression was observed in proximal tubule segments ( Figure 1B ) . Transcripts for Slc13a3 are found in the PST [39] , while Slc12a1 is restricted to the thick ascending limb ( TAL ) and macula densa ( MD ) ( Figure 1B ) [40 , 41] . Slc12a3 is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) ( Figure 1B ) [41] . Lastly , GATA-3 expression specifically marks the collecting ducts ( CD ) ( Figure 1B ) [42 , 43] . Based on this cross-species gene expression comparison , the following identities were assigned to the zebrafish pronephros segments we observed ( going from proximal to distal ) : podocytes ( pod ) , neck ( N ) , PCT , PST , distal early ( DE ) , corpuscle of Stannius ( CS ) , distal late ( DL ) , and the pronephric duct ( PD ) ( Figure 1A and 1E ) . Our division of PCT and PST within the tubule is based on the observation that the slc20a1a-expressing PCT cells undergo morphogenesis from a linear tube into a coiled structure by 5 days post-fertilization ( dpf ) , while the trpm7- and slc13a1-expressing PST segment maintains a linear structure ( Figure 1C ) . Expression of trpm7 and slc13a1 is discontinuous within the PST , an observation that has been shown recently to reflect the presence of two cell types in this region: transporting epithelia and multiciliated cells [44 , 45] . The renal corpuscle connects to the PCT via a short segment of cells that express the transcription factor rfx2 , and fails to express almost all of our PCT solute transporters ( Figure 1D ) . As rfx2 marks ciliated cells and rfx genes are essential regulators of ciliogenesis [46 , 47] , we hypothesize that this region corresponds to the ciliated neck segment found in other fish species as well as mammals [3\u20135] . However , a more detailed analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis . In addition to the neck segment , rfx2 expression was also detected in presumptive ciliated cells along the length of the PST and DE segments , as described previously [44 , 45] . For the distal tubule , we adopted the DE/DL nomenclature used in Xenopus [48] , although the zebrafish DE appears analogous to the TAL segment in mammals and the DL appears analogous to the mammalian DCT segment according to our gene expression comparison . We included the CS as a discrete segment , as it initially arises from the tubular progenitors within the pronephros , but by 48 hpf , it is located just dorsal to the DE/DL boundary [49 , 50] ( unpublished data ) . The DL segment expresses slc12a3 and connects to the cloaca via a short segment that expresses gata3 and likely represents the PD . Our data are consistent with the notion that the zebrafish pronephric kidney resembles a \u2018stretched-out\u201d' mammalian nephron , and suggests that rather than being composed of mostly nephric duct ( as currently believed ) , it is made up of extensive proximal and distal tubule epithelium ( Figure 1E ) . Between 24 and 48 hpf ( the start of blood filtration ) , the pronephros undergoes significant morphogenesis , including the midline migration of podocytes and the growth/extension of the tubules [9] . In order to better quantitate these morphological changes , as well as to precisely define the anatomical boundaries of each segment , we mapped the expression domains of segment-specific markers relative to the somites by performing double whole-mount in situ hybridization with myosin heavy chain ( mhc ) at 24 and 48 hpf ( Figures 2 and S1\u2013S4 ) . At 24 hpf , podocyte and neck progenitors are arranged in a slight curve at the level of somite 3\u20134 with the anterior boundary of the PCT level with somite 5 ( Figures 2 and S1 ) . By 48 hpf , the podocyte progenitors have fused at the midline ( level with somite 3 ) with the presumptive neck region forming a lateral extension that connects with the PCT also situated at the level of somite 3 ( Figures 2 and S3 ) . During this time , the length of the PCT , PST , and DE segments increased , possibly due to cell division within each segment ( Figure 2 and S1\u2013S4 ) . This growth may provide the driving force that is responsible for the shift in the anterior boundary of the PCT from somite 5 to somite 3 between 24 and 48 hpf , and for the coiling morphogenesis of the PCT observed between 72 and 144 hpf ( Figure 1C ) . However , the DL segment did not increase in length between 24 and 48 hpf , indicating that there is not a uniform expansion in all segments during development . During juvenile development ( 2\u20133 wk post-fertilization ) the DL segment is proportionately larger than the other segments , suggesting that its expansion predominates at later stages of development ( unpublished data ) . Interestingly , at 24 hpf , we observed an overlap of the DL and PD expression domains at the level of somite 17 ( Figure 2 and Figure S2 ) . This overlap may indicate the presence of an additional segment ( such as a discrete CNT equivalent ) , though to date we have not discovered any genes expressed solely in this domain . In addition to mapping the morphological changes that occur between 24 and 48 hpf , we also noted segment specific changes in gene expression patterns during this time . For example , transcripts for the solute transporters slc13a1 ( inorganic sulphate transporter ) , slc13a3 ( sodium-dicarboxylate carrier ) , and slc22a6 ( organic anion transporter ) were all absent from the PST segment at 24 hpf but were found expressed at 48 hpf ( Figures 2 and S3; and unpublished data ) . Similarly , transcripts for trpm7 ( divalent cation-selective ion channel ) and slc41a1 ( Mg 2+ transporter ) were not found in cells of the CS at 24 hpf but could be detected at 48 hpf ( Figure 2 and unpublished data ) . The up-regulation of these genes likely reflects the maturation/differentiation of the segment epithelia before the onset of blood filtration , which begins around 40 hpf [51 , 52] . However , the glomerulus does not fully mature until 4 dpf , based on the size exclusion of different-sized fluorescent dextrans [53] . Further profiling of segment expression patterns at later stages is needed to investigate whether the maturation of the transporting epithelial is also an ongoing process . We next sought to characterize the developmental pathways that establish the segmentation pattern of the pronephros . Retinoic acid ( RA ) is essential for the development of numerous tissues during embryogenesis [25] . In vertebrates , a gradient of RA in the upper trunk is responsible for directing the A-P patterning of the hindbrain into segmental compartments [15 , 54] , and gain or loss of RA also affects vertebral identity [25] . Interestingly , RA has been reported to regulate pronephros formation in Xenopus [55] . To explore whether RA was needed for pronephros segmentation , we injected wild-type zebrafish embryos with a morpholino to retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( raldh2 ) , which encodes an enzyme required to produce RA [20] . We then examined raldh2 morphants at 48 hpf with our panel of segment-specific markers , in combination with mhc expression to map segment length and location relative to the somites . Embryos deficient in raldh2 had fewer podocytes , as evidenced by punctate staining of the podocyte markers wt1b , wt1a , and mafb ( Figure 3A and unpublished data ) . Both proximal tubule segments were slightly shortened , based on the reduced expression domains of slc20a1a ( PCT ) and trpm7 ( PST ) ( Figure 3 ) . Conversely , the distal tubule was expanded in length , with the clck transporter ( marking both the DE and DL ) expressed in a greater proportion of the cdh17-positive pronephric tubule ( note that the overall length of raldh2 morphants is reduced compared to wild-type ) ( Figure 3 ) . Each segment within the distal tubule was moderately expanded , with a lengthened DE shown by expanded slc12a1 expression , enlarged clusters of stc1-expressing cells that comprise the CS , and lengthened DL shown by slc12a3 expression ( Figure 3 ) . The expression domain of gata3 ( PD ) was also expanded ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , the cloaca marker aqp3 was unchanged ( Figure 3A ) . These data suggest that RA signaling is necessary for podocyte formation and/or survival , as well as for establishing the normal pattern of nephron segmentation . Multiple enzymes are capable of synthesizing RA and a recent analysis of the neckless ( nls ) ( now called aldh1a2 ) mutant , which is defective in raldh2 , demonstrated that there are additional sources of raldh-like enzyme activity in the zebrafish embryo [56\u201358] . Based on this , we hypothesized that the nephron phenotype in raldh2 morphants represented the effect of reducing RA production , rather than a complete inhibition . To more fully block RA signaling , we utilized a competitive , reversible inhibitor of raldh enzymes , 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde ( DEAB ) [59] , which has been used to effectively prevent de novo RA synthesis in zebrafish embryos [58 , 60] . Wild-type embryos were treated with DEAB starting at 60% epiboly ( early gastrula ) until the 15 somite stage , and nephron segmentation was assayed at 48 hpf by double whole-mount in situ hybridization using mhc expression to mark the somites . Expression of the podocyte markers wt1b , wt1a , and mafb was absent in DEAB-treated embryos , suggesting that podocyte development was completely blocked ( Figure 3 and unpublished data ) . Expression of the PCT and PST markers slc20a1a and trpm7 was also absent , suggesting that these segments had failed to be specified ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , clck expression ( marking the DE and DL segments ) was dramatically expanded , such that it was present throughout the entire tubule territory ( Figure 3 ) . These findings suggest that the pronephric tubule adopts a distal tubule identity when RA synthesis is inhibited . Within this \u2018distal-only' pronephros , the DE marker slc12a1 was expressed from the anterior limit of the tubule to almost the middle of its length , the DL marker slc12a3 was expressed from the middle of the tubule to near its posterior limit , and the PD marker gata3 was expanded by an additional four somite lengths ( Figure 3 ) . A marked expansion of stc1-expressing cells was also detected , with multiple clusters of cells arranged in bilateral stripes , as opposed to the small groups of stc1-expressing cells seen in wild-type embryos ( Figure 3 ) . Expression of aqp3 was not altered , suggesting that progenitors of the cloaca are unaffected by the inhibition of RA production over this developmental interval ( Figure 3 ) . It is not known if the observed DEAB phenotype represents a full loss of RA signaling , as trace amounts of maternal RA have been detected in the yolk [61] and as zygotic raldh2 transcripts are expressed prior to 60% epiboly [56 , 57] . Nevertheless , our results demonstrate that RA , produced by raldh2 and possibly one or more unknown raldh enzymes , plays an essential role in the formation of proximal nephron fates ( podocytes , PCT , PST ) and in suppressing the expansion of distal fates ( DE , CS , DL , PD ) . To determine more precisely when RA signaling was needed for the development of proximal segment fates , we performed a DEAB timecourse experiment ( Figure 3 ) . Blocking RA signaling from 90% epiboly ( late gastrula ) to the 5 somite stage caused a milder phenotype than the longer 60%- 15-somite exposure that was characterized by a loss of podocytes , reduced lengths of the PCT and PST segments , and small increases in the lengths of the distal segments ( Figure 3 ) . A slightly longer DEAB treatment , from 90% epiboly to the 10 somite stage , expanded distal segments further than the raldh2 morphants or DEAB 90% epiboly-5 somite treated embryos ( Figure 3 ) . In addition , examination of the slc20a1a and trpm7 expression patterns showed that the PST segment was ablated , while the PCT was only slightly shortened ( Figure 3 ) . Loss of PST identity was also confirmed by the absence of slc13a1 and slc22a6 transcripts , which are additional PST markers ( Figure 2 and unpublished data ) . These findings suggest that , at least for this DEAB time window , the expansion of distal fates occurs at the expense of the PST segment . Finally , we tested whether DEAB treatment during somitogenesis would affect pronephros segmentation . DEAB treatment from 5\u201315 somites or 10\u201315 somites had no effect on the segmentation pattern of the pronephros ( unpublished data ) , thus suggesting that an inhibition of RA signaling must be initiated prior to the 5 somite stage in order to affect nephron patterning . Taken together , our DEAB timecourse data indicate that RA signaling is required to induce proximal nephron fates and to prevent an expansion of distal fates , thereby establishing the normal pronephric segmentation pattern . Interestingly , our data suggest that different segments have different temporal requirements for RA signaling . RA is essential between 90% epiboly and the 5 somite stage to induce podocytes , between 90% epiboly and 10 somites to induce PST formation , and between 60% epiboly and 15 somites to form the PCT . The PCT segment is the most refractory to RA inhibition and is only lost following the longest DEAB treatment window ( 60% epiboly to 15 somites ) . Given these findings , we tested whether increasing the concentration of RA by exogenous treatment would promote proximal nephron fates at the expense of distal fates . We exposed wild-type zebrafish embryos to RA during similar developmental intervals used for our DEAB experiments , and then assayed segment marker expression at 24 hpf by double in situ hybridization with mhc to mark the somites . Wild-type embryos treated with 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M RA between 90% epiboly and 5 somites developed a normal number of podocytes , as evidenced by wt1b expression , but displayed expanded proximal tubule domains , shown by expression of slc9a3 ( marking both the PCT and PST ) , slc20a1a ( PCT ) , and trpm7 ( PST ) ( Figure 4 ) . Conversely , the clck-expressing distal tubule domain was reduced , due to reductions in the length of the DL ( marked by slc12a3 ) and PD ( marked by gata3 ) ( Figure 4 ) . However , the DE segment ( marked by slc12a1 ) was unaffected ( Figure 4 ) . The position of the stc1-expressing CS segment cells was shifted posteriorly , and the level of expression was slightly reduced ( Figure 4 ) . A longer treatment window , from 60% epiboly\u201315 somites resulted in a more severe \u2018proximalized' phenotype with a longer expanse of proximal tubule and a greater reduction in each distal tubule domain ( Figure 4 ) . In these embryos , the position of the stc1-expressing CS population was shifted even more posteriorly , and was located at the distal edge of the yolk sac extension ( Figure 4A ) . We next treated wild-type embryos with higher dose of RA ( 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 M ) over this same 60% epiboly\u201315 somites time window , as well as two shorter time periods: 60% epiboly\u20135 somites , and 90% epiboly\u20135 somites . Embryos treated for any of these time windows displayed a completely \u2018proximalized' phenotype with the tubule domain being comprised entirely of proximal segment identities ( Figure 4 and unpublished data ) . In these embryos , the proximal marker slc9a3 was expressed throughout the cdh17-expressing tubule population ( Figure 4 and unpublished data ) . Within this \u2018proximal-only' pronephros , the PCT marker slc20a1a was expressed from the anterior limit of the tubule to somite 13 , and the PST marker trpm7 was expressed from somite 14 to the posterior limit of the tubule , where the trpm7-expressing tubules fused at the prospective site of the cloaca ( Figure 4 and unpublished data ) . Expression of all distal segment markers was absent , suggesting that the DE , CS , DL , and PD had failed to be specified ( Figure 4 and unpublished data ) . These results show that exogenous RA treatment from gastrulation stages until the 5 somite stage is sufficient to \u2018proximalize' the pronephros , suggesting that this time period is the critical window when RA signaling is required for proximo-distal patterning of pronephric progenitors . To further explore the notion that RA alters the patterning of renal progenitors prior to the 5 somite stage , we examined the expression patterns of the Notch ligands deltaC ( dlc ) and jagged2a ( jag2a ) , and the renal transcription factors wt1a , pax2a , pax8 , and evi1 , as these genes are detected in the IM during early somitogenesis and have been implicated in early nephron patterning [44 , 62\u201364] . Wild-type embryos were treated with DMSO , DEAB , or 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 M RA from 60% epiboly until the 6 somite stage , and then IM gene expression was assayed by whole-mount double in situ hybridization together with myoD to mark the somites . Transcripts for pax2a and pax8 , which label all pronephric progenitors , were found throughout the IM domain in a similar pattern in wild-type , DEAB-treated , and RA-treated embryos ( Figure S5 ) . Consistent with our previous results , wt1a expression was absent in DEAB-treated embryos , and wt1a was strongly up-regulated in RA-treated embryos ( Figure S5 ) . The expression domains of deltaC and jag2a , normally restricted to a proximal region of the IM adjacent to somites 2\u20135 , were absent in DEAB-treated embryos , and expanded posteriorly in RA-treated embryos ( Figure S5 ) . Expression of evi1 , found in the distal portion of the IM starting around somite 6 , was shifted anteriorly to somite 3 following DEAB treatment and reduced to the most posterior group of IM cells following RA treatment ( Figure S5 ) . These findings demonstrate that changes in RA dosage during gastrulation to early somitogenesis are associated with gene expression changes in IM progenitors , far in advance of their mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition that creates the pronephric tubules . In addition to RA , multiple tissues along the embryonic axis are segmentally patterned by the cdx genes [25 , 34] . Loss of cdx gene function leads to an expansion of anterior trunk fates and axial elongation defects that result in a loss/truncation of the posterior trunk and tail [23\u201330 , 34] . In zebrafish , cdx4\u2013/\u2013 mutant embryos display expanded wt1a expression at the 15-somite stage , suggesting that the podocyte lineage might be expanded and thus implicating cdx genes in pronephros patterning [24] . We therefore examined the formation of the pronephros in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx1a/4-deficient ( herein referred to as cdx-deficient ) to assess development of the renal corpuscle , tubule , and pronephric duct . In addition , we used differential interference contrast ( DIC ) optics to visualize the somite boundaries and determine the size and position of each segment relative to the somites . It is important to note that the size of posterior somites in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , and both the size and number of the somites in cdx-deficient embryos , is greatly reduced toward the posterior , due to the axial elongation defect [24 , 29\u201330] . A similar defect has also been observed in mouse Cdx mutants [34] . At 24 hpf , wild-type embryos expressed wt1a in presumptive podocytes ( located adjacent to somite 3 , marked by an arrow in Figure 5A ) as well as a population of presumptive mesenchymal cells located next to somites 1\u20133 in a broad lateral domain ( indicated by a bracket and \u2018M' in Figure 5A ) . cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos had expanded wt1a expression at 24 hpf that ranged from a position anterior to somite 1 to approximately somite 7 , and cdx-deficient embryos showed an even more dramatic posterior expansion that reached somite 12 ( Figure 5A ) . As the expansion of wt1a in cdx mutant embryos could indicate increased numbers of podocytes and/or the mesenchymal population , we examined wt1b expression , which specifically marks podocytes [65] . Equivalent numbers of wt1b-expressing podocytes were formed in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 mutant and wild-type embryos , but podocytes in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos were located more posteriorly , at the level of somite 5 ( Figure 5A ) . cdx-deficient embryos developed a normal number of wt1b-expressing podocytes , though they were arranged in a pair of somewhat irregular linear groupings ( rather than forming bilateral spherical clusters ) , and they were also located more posteriorly , adjacent to somite 7 ( Figure 5A ) . We conclude from these observations that the loss of cdx4 and cdx1a/4 function progressively expands wt1a expression without increasing the number of podocytes and leads to podocyte formation at more posterior locations along the embryonic axis . To assess tubule formation in cdx mutants , we examined the expression of cdh17 at 24 hpf . While cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos formed complete tubules that fused at the cloaca , cdx-deficient embryos displayed cdh17 expression that was reduced and discontinuous , with the tubules failing to fuse ( Figure 5A ) . Consistent with the posterior shifts in podocyte position , the A-P position of the tubule , marked by cdh17 transcripts , was shifted caudally in both cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos . In wild-type embryos , the tubule spans the length of somites 4\u201318 , but was located from somites 6\u201320 in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , and from somites 8\u201313 in cdx-deficient embryos ( Figure 5A ) . We next characterized the tubule segmentation pattern in cdx mutant embryos by examining the expression patterns of slc20a1a ( PCT ) , trpm7 ( PST ) , slc12a1 ( DE ) , stc1 ( CS ) , slc12a3 ( DL ) , gata3 ( PD ) , and aqp3 ( cloaca ) . cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos showed a slight expansion of the PCT , which spanned an additional two somites compared to wild-types ( Figure 5A and unpublished data ) . The PST , DE , CS , and PD were all shorter than normal in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , with the PD displaying the most severe reduction in length ( Figure 5A and unpublished data ) . Transcripts for aqp3 were not detected in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , suggesting a defect in cloaca development ( Figure 5A ) . These results indicate that loss of cdx4 leads to a slight expansion in PCT fate with corresponding reductions in more distal fates . In contrast to cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , cdx-deficient embryos showed discontinuous slc20a1a expression and failed to express trpm7 , slc12a1 , stc1 , slc12a3 , gata3 , or aqp3 ( Figure 5A ) . These results suggest that the tubule territory in cdx-deficient embryos acquires a PCT identity , while the remaining nephron segments fail to develop . These defects were not the result of delayed development , as at later developmental stages , cdx-deficient embryos continued to possess tubules that only expressed PCT-markers , and the tubules never fused caudally ( unpublished data ) . In addition , expression analysis of the podocyte marker mafB in cdx-deficient embryos at 48 hpf revealed that podocytes fail to fuse into a single renal corpuscle . Instead , the podocytes formed bilateral corpuscles that were dilated compared to wild-type and cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , presumably due to fluid accumulation ( Figure 5B ) . Consistent with this , cdx-deficient embryos had developed glomerular cysts by 72 hpf , as well as severe pericardial edema , indicative of renal failure ( Figure 5C ) . In contrast , cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos never exhibited glomerular cyst formation or edema , suggesting that although various segment lengths were shortened , these embryos were able to maintain adequate kidney function ( Figure 5C ) . In summary , our expression analyses show that cdx deficiency causes a posterior shift in the location of the pronephros along the embryonic axis ( Figure 5D ) . While the podocytes and PCT populations formed relatively normally , the PST and distal tubule segments were reduced or absent in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos , respectively ( Figure 5D ) . Thus the cdx genes , acting either directly or indirectly , are required for the formation of the distal nephron segments and establishing the normal segmentation pattern of the pronephros . Given the largely opposite effects of cdx-deficiency and loss of RA signaling on nephron patterning , as well as the recent report that cdx genes control how the hindbrain responds to RA during its patterning [30 , 31] , we wondered if an interplay between these pathways was operative during pronephros segmentation . The location and level of RA within tissues is dependent on the expression of raldh-synthesizing enzymes and cyp26-degrading enzymes [15 , 54] . We therefore investigated the expression of these genes in cdx-deficient embryos during early somitogenesis , as our previous experiments suggested that the IM is being influenced by RA signaling at this time . At the 5 somite stage , expression of raldh2 in the paraxial mesoderm was expanded posteriorly in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos compared to wild-types ( Figure 6A ) . An even greater posterior expansion was seen in cdx-deficient embryos , with raldh2 transcripts being detected throughout the entire unsegmented paraxial mesoderm and tailbud region ( Figure 6A ) . Expression of the RA-catabolizing enzyme cyp26a1 in the upper trunk region was also expanded posteriorly in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos at the 5 somite stage , and more extensively expanded in cdx-deficient embryos ( Figure 6A ) . To visualize how the combined changes in raldh2 and cyp26a1 expression altered the source of RA along the trunk , we generated digital overlays of these expression patterns . This analysis suggested that the anterior boundary of RA production ( i . e . , the junction of the cyp26a1 and raldh2 expression domains ) was located more posteriorly in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 mutants compared to wild-types , and that this posterior shift was more pronounced in cdx-deficient embryos ( arrows in Figure 6A ) . To better quantitate these posterior shifts , we examined expression of raldh2 and cyp26a1 at the 10 somite stage when the somites could be visualized by staining for myoD transcripts . We found that the raldh2 expression boundary in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos was shifted posteriorly by 1 and 2 somites , respectively , compared to wild-type embryos ( Figure 6B ) . The cyp26a1 domain in wild-type embryos occupied the region of somites 2\u20133 , just rostral and slightly overlapping with raldh2 , as shown by double in situ hybridization ( Figure 6B ) . In cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , cyp26a1 transcripts were detected in the region of somites 3\u20135 , whereas in cdx-deficient embryos they extended from somites 3\u20137 ( Figure 6B ) . These analyses reveal a striking correlation between the presumptive source of RA at the 10 somite stage and the axial position of the pronephros at 24 hpf in each genotype ( i . e . , the source of RA and the position of the pronephros both start at somites 3 , 5 , and 7 in wild-type , cdx4\u2013/\u2013 , and cdx-deficient embryos , respectively ) . The combination of these data , together with the results from our DEAB experiments , suggest a model in which the cdx genes act upstream of raldh2 and cyp26a1 to localize the source of RA along the A-P axis , and that RA , in turn , acts on the IM to induce the proximal segments and prevent an expansion of the distal segment fates . If our model is correct , then inhibiting RA synthesis in cdx-deficient embryos should rescue pronephric positioning and the formation of the distal tubule segments . To test this , we treated cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos with DEAB from 90% epiboly to the 5-somite stage and examined pronephros segmentation . In support of our model , we found that cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos exhibited a one-somite anterior shift in the position of the pronephros , as shown by expression of cdh17 ( Figure 7 ) . In addition , the development of podocytes was abrogated , and the length of the PCT was reduced in DEAB-treated cdx4\u2013/\u2013 and cdx-deficient embryos ( Figure 7 ) , consistent with our findings in wild-type embryos ( Figure 3 ) . We observed that the DE segment was increased in DEAB-treated cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos , as shown by an expansion of the slc12a1 expression domain ( Figure 7 ) . DEAB treatment also increased the number of CS cells in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 mutants , shown by the expression of stc1 , and increased the DL segment length , evidenced by expansion of the slc12a3 , romk2 , and clck expression domains ( Figure 7 and unpublished data ) . In cdx-deficient embryos treated with DEAB , formation of the DE , CS , and DL segments was rescued , shown by expression of slc12a1 , stc1 , and slc12a3 , respectively ( Figure 7 ) . A similar rescue of the expression of the DE and DL markers romk2 and clck was also observed ( unpublished data ) . These findings demonstrate that cdx gene function is not necessary to specify distal segment identity directly , but instead suggests that the abrogation of distal segment formation in cdx-deficient mutants is related to the level of RA that the renal progenitors are exposed to . Taken together with the above results , these finding provide good evidence that the pronephric positioning defect and failure to form the distal tubule identities in cdx-deficient embryos is caused by mis-localization of the RA source along the A-P axis . \n Retinoid signaling plays essential roles in the A-P patterning of a number of diverse tissues in the embryo . During early development , a source of RA in the upper trunk ( cervical ) region is produced by the action of the RA synthetic enzyme , Raldh2 , which is expressed in the anterior paraxial mesoderm [54] . The coordinate expression of RA-catabolizing Cyp26 enzymes in surrounding tissues creates a so-called \u2018sink' for this RA source [54] . Collectively , these enzymes are thought to create a gradient of RA activity that diffuses into surrounding tissues [34 , 54] . The functions of this RA source have been extensively studied in the developing hindbrain , where the effects of graded RA signaling are thought to create nested expression domains of RA-responsive genes that drive A-P segmentation of the hindbrain into a series of rhombomeres [15 , 54] . In addition to regionalizing the overlying neurectoderm , RA produced in the upper trunk paraxial mesoderm has been implicated in the regionalization of the underlying endoderm . Studies in zebrafish have shown that RA acts directly on the endoderm to specify hepatopancreatic progenitors that give rise to the liver and pancreas [17 , 18] . RA also influences mesodermal cell fate decisions during zebrafish development , including the formation of the pectoral fin field\u2014which arises from the lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to the upper trunk somites [56 , 57 , 66]\u2014and the heart [67] . In the latter case , inhibition of RA synthesis leads to an expansion of precardiac mesoderm , resulting in an excessive number of myocardial progenitors [67] . These findings indicate that , in addition to acting as an inducer of cell fates such as in the hindbrain and endoderm , RA also plays an important role in restricting certain cell fates . Our study now adds the IM as another mesodermal derivative that is patterned by RA . Our results show that RA production is essential during gastrulation and early somitogenesis for the induction of proximal nephron fates as well as to restrict the expansion of distal nephron fates . Over this period of development , RA is produced by the anterior paraxial mesoderm ( PM ) . The IM , which gives rise to the pronephros , is located lateral to the PM ( Figure 8 ) . Given the role of RA as a diffusible morphogen in other tissues , we hypothesize that RA diffuses from the PM and establishes a gradient along the IM , with high levels of RA inducing proximal fates and low RA levels being permissive for distal fates ( Figure 8 ) . Our time-course experiments with DEAB support this view , with the most severe reduction in proximal fates ( and concomitant expansion in distal segments ) corresponding to the longest treatment window . However , further work is needed to determine the nature of the RA gradient , as well as how dynamic fluctuations in retinoid availability [54] affect the dose and length of time that the renal progenitors are exposed to RA . A gradient-free model has recently been proposed for RA-dependent hindbrain patterning , based on the finding that sequential expression domains of the cyp26a1 , cyp26b1 , and cyp26c1 genes are essential for rhombomere boundary establishment [68 , 69] . It is unclear if a similar mechanism might operate during pronephros segmentation , as cyp26b1 and cyp26c1 do not show a nested pattern of expression in the IM . Overall , the effects of RA on the patterning of the IM can be regarded as \u2018anteriorizing . ' Our finding that exogenous RA treatment induces proximal tubule fates to form throughout the pronephros supports this conclusion . Classically , RA is known as a \u2018posteriorizing' factor due to its effects on the central nervous system , where an inhibition of RA signaling causes an expansion of anterior neural fates in the hindbrain [15 , 54] . Thus we conclude that RA can actually have both anteriorizing and posteriorizing activities , depending on the tissue in question . A unified way to characterize these effects would be to consider the upper trunk RA source as an organizing center , akin to the dorsal organizer in the gastrula , that locally patterns cell types in all three germ layers . Previous studies have implicated RA as a regulator of renal development . Animal cap experiments in Xenopus showed that RA , together with Activin , is sufficient to induce the formation of pronephric tubules [70] . A more recent study in Xenopus reported that overexpressing various RA antagonists results in a complete loss of the pronephros ( glomus , tubules , and duct ) [55] . This phenotype is more severe than what we observed and may reflect differences in the efficacy of DEAB to completely block RA production compared with other RA antagonists . The pronephric tubules in Xenopus are segmented into proximal and distal segments [48] , similar to the zebrafish pronephros , however a role for RA in Xenopus nephron segmentation has not been reported . In mammals , it has long been known that vitamin A deficiency causes severe renal malformations [71] . Targeted mutagenesis of the RAR genes in mouse , followed by elegant rescue experiments , established an important role for RA as a dose-dependent inducer of the GDNF receptor Ret [72 , 73] . GDNF is an essential regulator of ureteric bud branching morphogenesis , and loss of GDNF signaling results most frequently in renal agenesis [74] . Because ureteric bud branching is an essential prerequisite for nephrogenesis , RA serves a key role in stimulating nephron formation . At present it is not known whether RA is also involved in the proximodistal patterning of metanephric nephrons . Interestingly , Raldh2 transcripts are found in podocyte progenitors , whereas Cyp26a1 is expressed by the tubule anlagen during metanephros development , suggestive of a role for RA in mammalian nephron patterning [75] . Transplantation studies in frogs suggest that RA may act directly on pronephric precursors [55] . However , the downstream targets of RA in the IM are not known . In the hindbrain , the presumptive RA gradient is thought to regulate rhombomere segmentation by activating the expression of the anterior , 3' Hox genes , i . e . , those comprising the 1st through 5th paralog groups [15 , 54 , 76] . In zebrafish , transcripts for hoxb1a , hoxb1b , and hoxb5a are found in proximal portions of the IM , thus making them potential candidates for mediating the effects of RA during pronephros segmentation [34] . Future studies using single , double , and triple morpholino injections can test the importance of these hox genes for renal development . The effects of RA on pronephric segmentation may also be coordinated by the action of non-Hox pathways . Our results suggest the intriguing possibility that RA signaling targets may include renal transcription factors as well as members of the Notch signaling pathway . The gene evi1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that has been implicated in patterning distal regions of the pronephros in Xenopus , and overexpression of evi1 was found to inhibit proximal segment formation [63] . These data are consistent with our results showing that expression of evi1 in the IM was expanded following DEAB treatment , and reduced following exposure to exogenous RA . Another renal transcription factor candidate is the odd-skipped related transcription factor 1 ( osr1 ) encoding a zinc-finger repressor . Recent studies in Xenopus and zebrafish have shown that osr1 is expressed in the ventral mesoderm during gastrulation and later in an anterior domain of the IM [77] . Morpholino-mediated knock-down of osr1 leads to defects in the formation of podocytes and proximal tubule progenitors [77] , consistent with Osr1 participating in a common pathway with RA . The Notch pathway may also interact with RA during nephron segmentation . Conditional knockout of Notch2 in the mouse metanephros results in a loss of podocytes and proximal tubule fates , whereas distal markers are relatively unaffected [78] . In zebrafish , Notch signaling has been shown to regulate the differentiation of multiciliated cells and principle cells in the pronephric tubules [44 , 45] . However , a role for Notch signaling in the formation of proximal nephron fates is also suggested by the expression pattern of the Notch ligands deltaC , jag1b , and jag2a , which are restricted to proximal portions of the intermediate mesoderm [62 , 64] . Simultaneous knockdown of jag1b/2a results in an abnormally small renal corpuscle and dysmorphic proximal tubules , consistent with a conserved role for Notch signaling in proximal nephron development [79] . Our finding that DEAB treatment abrogates deltaC and jag2a expression in the proximal IM , while exogenous RA expands their expression , supports a role for RA acting upstream of the Notch pathway . Our study provides evidence that cdx genes control the expression domains of raldh2 and cyp26a1 along the embryonic axis . The boundaries of both raldh2 and cyp26a1 are progressively shifted toward the posterior in cdx4 and cdx1a/4-deficient embryos , suggesting that the upper trunk source of RA is posteriorly shifted . We hypothesize that this posterior shift in RA production results in a posterior shift in the position of the pronephros ( Figure 8 ) . We propose that this effect , combined with the axial elongation defects , leads to reduced or absent distal segment fates . The ability to rescue distal segments by treating cdx mutants with a pulse of DEAB is consistent with this model , and also demonstrates that cdx function is not requisite for the induction of distal fates from the intermediate mesoderm . Thus additional , as yet unidentified pathways , are responsible for directing distal fates . While our data supports the notion that Cdx factors exert their effects by the regulation of RA signaling , it does not rule out the possibility that Cdx factors may also function to repress proximal fates independent of RA signaling . Given the mounting evidence that the upper trunk RA source is an important organizing center , we would predict that both the patterning and positioning of numerous organs would be affected in cdx mutants . Consistent with this , defects in several mesodermal fates that arise in the anterior trunk region have been observed in cdx-deficient embryos . Vascular precursors are progressively expanded when cdx activity is abrogated , and blood precursors are both reduced and shifted posteriorly in cdx mutants [24 , 29] . In addition to mesodermal defects , cdx mutants also display patterning defects in the neurectoderm that gives rise to the anterior spinal cord [30 , 31] . We hypothesize that many , if not all , of these defects in cdx mutants are caused by the abnormal localization of RA along the A-P axis . The loss of cdx gene function in both zebrafish and murine models has been shown to cause global shifts in hox gene expression in the mesoderm and neurectoderm [24 , 25 , 29\u201330 , 34] . Given the rostral shifts and expansions of both raldh2 and cyp26a1 expression observed in cdx4 and cdx1a/4-deficient embryos , Hox transcription factors are attractive molecules for regulating raldh2 and cyp26a1 expression . Defects in blood formation in cdx4-null zebrafish can be rescued by the overexpression of several hox genes [24] , and the overexpression of hoxa9a also results in a partial rescue of the axis elongation defect in cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos [29] . Future studies are needed to examine whether hox gene overexpression ( s ) can rescue pronephros positioning and formation of distal segments in cdx mutant embryos . In conclusion , our studies have revealed an important link between the cdx genes and localization of RA , and provide evidence that RA signaling is a central determinant of pronephros A-P segmentation . Our results establish the zebrafish embryo as a simplified model of vertebrate nephron segmentation that will further our understanding of mammalian nephron segmentation , and provide insights into the causes of kidney birth defects and renal disease in humans . \n Zebrafish were maintained and staged as described [80 , 81] . T\u00fcbingen strain wild-type embryos were used for all experiments . DEAB and all-trans retinoic acid ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) to make a 1 M stock and aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C . For DEAB and RA treatments: embryos were incubated in 1 . 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 M DEAB/DMSO in E3 embryo media , 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 M or 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M RA/DMSO in E3 embryo media , or 1 . 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 M DMSO ( control ) in E3 in the dark over particular developmental intervals , then washed five times with E3 and then fixed at 24 or 48 hpf . These experimental treatments were fully penetrant and produced consistent results at the doses and treatment windows that were examined . raldh2 morpholino ( CAACTTCACTGGAGGTCATCGCGTC ) was injected into 1-cell wild-type embryos . Incrosses of kggtv205 heterozygous adults ( maintained on the T\u00fcbingen strain ) were used to obtain cdx4\u2013/\u2013 embryos and were injected at the 1-cell stage with cdx1a morpholino ( CAGCAGATAGCTCACGGACATTTTC ) as described [29] to obtain cdx-deficient embryos . Both raldh2 and cdx1a morpholinos produced fully penetrant effects . Embryos were raised to appropriate stages and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) /1\u00d7PBST for gene expression analysis . For all reported gene expressions , at least 20 embryos were examined . Whole-mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos was performed as previously described [24] .

Gene-specific primers spanning 700\u20131 , 000 bp of the coding sequence were used to amplify DNA fragments from E15 . 5/P0 kidney cDNA pools , and the PCR products of the right size were cloned into the pCRII-Topo vector ( primer sequences available upon request ) . DNA templates for riboprobe production were generated by PCR with T7 and Sp6 Ready Made primers ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) from PCRII-TOPO clones or T7 and T3 Ready Made primers from Bmap library clones . Digoxigenin-labeled anti-sense riboprobes were synthesized from the PCR product and purified with Micro Bio-spin columns P-30 Tris RNase-free ( Bio-Rad ) . Probes were diluted with prehybridization buffer ( 50% formamide , 5\u00d7SSC , pH4 . 5 , 50 \u03bcg/ml yeast tRNA , 1% SDS , 50 \u03bcg/ml heparin ) to 10 \u03bcg/ml and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C . Neonatal kidneys were dissected free of surrounding tissues except the ureter and fixed with 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h . After PBS washes , they were incubated with 30% sucrose at 4 \u00b0C overnight . Kidneys were swirled in five dishes of OCT to remove sucrose and mounted in OCT in a dry ice/ethanol bath . The OCT blocks were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C . Sections were cut at 20 \u03bcm and air dried . Sections were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min , treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K for 10 min and post-fixed for 5 min . Slides were acetylated ( 1 . 33% Triethanolamine , 0 . 065% HCl , 0 . 375% acetic anhydride ) for 10 min and dehydrated with 70% ethanol and 95% ethanol for 5 min each . Slides were air dried then incubated with 500 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes at 68 \u00b0C overnight . Hybridized sections were washed with 50% formamide , 1\u00d7SSC , pH4 . 5 for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C , treated with 2 \u03bcg/ml RNase for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C , and washed with 2\u00d7SSC , pH4 . 5 for 30 min , and twice with 0 . 2\u00d7SSC , pH4 . 5 for 30 min at 65 \u00b0C .

{"lay_summary": "Many species of bats in North America have been severely impacted by a fungal disease , white-nose syndrome , that has killed over 5 million bats since it was first identified in 2006 . The fungus is believed to have been introduced into a cave in New York where bats hibernate , and has now spread to 29 states and 4 Canadian provinces . The fungus is nearly identical from all sites where it has been isolated; however , we discovered that the fungus harbors a virus , and the virus varies enough to be able to use it to understand how the fungus has been spreading . This study used samples from infected bats throughout Pennsylvania and New York , and New Brunswick , Canada , as well a few isolates from other northeastern states . The evolution of the virus recapitulates the spread of the virus across these geographical areas , and should be useful for studying the further spread of the fungus .", "article": "White-nose syndrome is one of the most lethal wildlife diseases , killing over 5 million North American bats since it was first reported in 2006 . The causal agent of the disease is a psychrophilic filamentous fungus , Pseudogymnoascus destructans . The fungus is widely distributed in North America and Europe and has recently been found in some parts of Asia , but interestingly , no mass mortality is observed in European or Asian bats . Here we report a novel double-stranded RNA virus found in North American isolates of the fungus and show that the virus can be used as a tool to study the epidemiology of White-nose syndrome . The virus , termed Pseudogymnoascus destructans partitivirus-pa , contains 2 genomic segments , dsRNA 1 and dsRNA 2 of 1 . 76 kbp and 1 . 59 kbp respectively , each possessing a single open reading frame , and forms isometric particles approximately 30 nm in diameter , characteristic of the genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus is closely related to Penicillium stoloniferum virus S . We were able to cure P . destructans of the virus by treating fungal cultures with polyethylene glycol . Examination of 62 isolates of P . destructans including 35 from United States , 10 from Canada and 17 from Europe showed virus infection only in North American isolates of the fungus . Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of the viral coat protein geographically clustered North American isolates indicating fungal spread followed by local adaptation of P . destructans in different regions of the United States and Canada . This is the first demonstration that a mycovirus potentially can be used to study fungal disease epidemiology . \n Pseudogymnoascus destructans ( Pd; previously named Geomyces destructans ) is an emerging fungal pathogen responsible for a fatal disease , white-nose syndrome ( WNS ) in hibernating bats in North America [1\u20133] . Experts estimate over 5 millions bats died from WNS in North America since the disease was first noted in New York in 2006 [4\u20136] . Currently WNS has spread to at least 29 states in the United States ( plus three additional states where Pd presence has been confirmed , but not WNS ) and five provinces in Canada [4] . The fungus is widely distributed in Europe [6 , 7] and recently has been reported from the northeast of China and Siberia [8 , 9] , but no mass mortality has been reported in European or Asian bats [6 , 8] . Pd\u2019s lethal effect on North American bats coupled with its clonal genotype in North American isolates [10 , 11] , its single mating type [12] and the absence of close relatives [13] led many researchers to hypothesize a recent introduction to North America [1 , 6 , 14 , 15] . Pd is confirmed in seven North American [1 , 4] and 13 European species of bats [4 , 9] . The natural history of the genus Pseudogymnoascus and its allies indicate that they are commonly isolated from soils in colder regions of the world [16] . Unlike Pd many of its close relatives are cellulolytic saprobes and non-pathogenic [16 , 17] . Mycoviruses associated with fungi have drawn interest because of their potential roles in fungal biology and pathogenicity [18] . Mycoviruses are very frequent in fungi and generally maintain a persistent lifestyle [19] . Horizontal transmission is very rare , and is likely restricted to closely related strains , although phylogenetic studies indicate transmission among species has occurred [20] . Transmission has only been documented in a few cases outside the laboratory [21] . Most mycoviruses are cryptic with no known biological effects on their fungal hosts , although there is a lack of research in this area . However , there are significant examples where mycoviruses play important roles in fungal biology and ecology [22] . Here we used mycoviruses of Pd as a tool to study the epidemiology of WNS . We investigated mycoviruses in Pd and show that population variation of a Pd-mycovirus can be useful in tracing the spread of WNS . \n We examined 62 isolates of Pd from North American and European bats for mycoviruses ( Table 1 ) . The isolates were cultured from four North American and one European species of bats and were collected from 2008 to 2015 . North American isolates included 14 from Pennsylvania , seven from New York , six from West Virginia , three from North Carolina , three from Vermont , one from Ohio , one from Indiana and 10 from New Brunswick , Canada . We screened 16 isolates of Pd from the Czech Republic and one isolate from Slovakia in Europe . Double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) extracted from all North American isolates showed two bands\u2014a larger band close to 1 . 8 kb ( RNA 1 ) and a smaller band close to 1 . 6 kb ( RNA 2 ) in electrophoretic analysis ( Fig 1A ) . None of the European isolates contained these dsRNAs , although two , CCF-4127 and CCF-4128 , had dsRNAs profiles different from that of the North American isolates ( Fig 1B ) . We found no dsRNAs of viral origin in five isolates of Geomyces sp . from Antarctic soil or in six isolates of Pseudogymnoascus sp . from cave soils in Pennsylvania ( S1 Table ) . The dsRNA enrichment method is based on the premise that uninfected plants or fungi normally do not contain detectable amounts of high molecular weight dsRNA , and , when present , dsRNA is an indicator of a viral genome [23] . Sanger sequencing of cDNA clones from RNAs 1 and 2 of the North American isolates of Pd obtained from random primed RT-PCR provided nearly complete genomic sequences; ends were determined by 5'- primer ligated RNA ligase mediated-rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RLM-RACE ) [24] providing consensus genomic sequences for RNAs 1 and 2 of 1761 bp and 1590 bp . Northern-blots using cDNA clones from RNA 1 or RNA 2 as probes confirmed the identity of the dsRNA bands ( Fig 1C ) . We named this new virus Pseudogymnoascus destructans partitivirus-pa ( PdPV-pa; the pa indicates the sequenced isolate is from Pennsylvania ) . A BLASTx search of GenBank showed closest similarity of RNA 1 of PdPV-pa with RNA 1 of Penicillium stoloniferum virus S ( PsV-S ) , with 76% amino acid ( aa ) identity . Similarly , RNA 2 of Pd showed closest similarity with the RNA 2 of PsV-S with 67% aa identity . PsV-S is the type species of the genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae [25] . Sequence analysis of RNA 1 of PdPV-pa predicted a single open reading frame ( ORF ) of 540 aa ( 60 kDa ) that codes for a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) ( Fig 2A ) . RNA 2 also contained a single ORF of 470 aa ( 52 kDa ) that codes for a putative coat protein ( CP ) ( Fig 2B ) . Amino acid level sequence identity of PdPV-pa RdRp and CP with the approved members of genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae ranges from 58% - 76% and 36% - 67% respectively , which are within the species demarcation criteria ( RdRp \u2264 90%; CP \u2264 80% ) of the genus [42] . Further , the 5' termini of PdPV-pa RNAs 1 and 2 coding strand share a conserved CGCAAAA\u2026 sequence , where G is followed by A , U , or C but not G in the next 5 to 6 nucleotide positions , characteristic of the genus Gammmapartitivirus [25] ( Fig 2C ) . Similarly , the 3' terminal 50 nucleotides of RNAs 1 and 2 were adenosine ( A ) rich in the range ( 7\u201324 nt ) typical of members of the Gammapartitivirus genus [25] ( Fig 2D ) . PdPV-pa particles were purified from mycelia of Pd and negative-stain transmission electron microscopy showed isometric particles of approximately 30 nm diameter , characteristic of members of the Partitiviridae ( Fig 3A ) . PdPV-pa dsRNAs were also extracted from the purified virus particles to reconfirm their presence as genomic RNAs ( Fig 3B ) . Bayesian trees constructed using aa sequences from the RdRp and CP of PdPV-pa clustered PdPV-pa with other members of genus Gammapartitivirus in the Partitiviridae family ( Fig 4A & 4B ) . In both RdRp and CP trees , PdPV-pa appeared as a sister branch to PsV-S with strong posterior probability support of 92% and 100% respectively suggesting PdPV-pa is evolutionary close to PsV-S . The genome structure of PdPV-pa , conserved features in its RNAs explained above , its particle morphology , its RdRp and CP amino acid sequence identity within species demarcation criteria , and phylogenetic analyses all confirmed that PdPV-pa is a novel partitivirus belonging to genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae . We attempted several methods including single spore isolation , hyphal tip culture , protoplast culture , heat therapy and nutritional and chemical stress that involved application of the antiviral drugs cycloheximide or ribavirin , to cure Pd of the PdPV-pa infection . However , only partial success was achieved with high concentrations of cycloheximide ( 25 \u03bcg/ml ) and ribavirin ( 300 \u03bcM ) treatments after three passages . PdPV-pa remained suppressed in the fungus treated with cycloheximide or ribavirin when grown in media with the drug but once the fungus was transferred to drug-free media the virus reappeared . Finally , our attempt to cure the fungus using polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) -induced matric potential in minimal nutrition media made PdPV-pa undetectable . PdPV-pa infection in Pd was checked under matric potential gradients starting from -2MPa , -3MPa to -4MPa . We did not observe visible germination of Pd conidia or mycelia growth at -5MPa and -6MPa . PdPV-pa was undetected in PEG treated Pd isolates when evaluated by dsRNA extraction and RT-PCR with RdRp specific primers for PdPV-pa ( Fig 5A & 5B ) . The detection limit of PdPV-pa in Pd was determined to be approximately 380 copies per cell ( S1 Appendix ) . We enriched the viral dsRNA from total nucleic acid extracted from a defined number of Pd conidia followed by measurement of dsRNA concentration , and serial dilutions to determine the end-point of detection . Pd isolates where PdPV-pa was undetected after PEG treatment lost the characteristic gray pigmentation of wild type Pd and appeared white ( Fig 6A ) . The virus-free isolate also produced significantly less conidia in comparison to wild type isolate ( Fig 6B ) . Although PEG treatments were successful in obtaining a PdPV-pa free isolate of Pd , PdPV-pa tolerance to many other stresses mentioned above indicate that PdPV-pa is tightly associated with the Pd isolates from North America . Genetic variability of the RdRp and CP regions was analyzed in 45 North American isolates of PdPV-pa by amplification using specific primers followed by sequence analysis ( Fig 7A & 7B ) . Using a 930 bp region of RdRp amplicons after trimming and alignment , we found the average percentage identity ranged from 99 . 7 to 99 . 9 among the 45 isolates . The high level of conservation in the RdRp is also reflected by a total of only 15 segregating sites , including seven singletons among the isolates examined . For the CP , nucleotide variability was higher: in a 1088 bp of amplicon of the CP , the average percent identity ranged from 96 . 8 to 98 . 4 and included 127 segregating sites out of which 69 were singletons . The Bayesian tree based on the RdRp nucleotide sequences of 45 North American isolates of PdPV-pa produced a largely unresolved tree with no clusters with significant support . However , the Bayesian tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of the CP clustered the 45 PdPV-pa isolates into two major clades based on their geographical distribution ( Fig 8 ) . One clade was comprised of Canadian isolates; the other clade included isolates from the USA , although the posterior probability of this separation was lower than for other branching in the tree . The USA clade further included well supported clusters of isolates from New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , North Carolina , Vermont , Indiana and Ohio . Indiana and Ohio had one isolate each and separated as sister branches . The separate topologies of USA and Canadian clusters indicate independent diversification of Pd isolates subsequent to movement to particular regions . Within each major clade there were examples of sub-branching topologies representing isolates based on their local distribution although the pattern was not consistent throughout . The phylogeny of the PdPV-pa isolates showed no structure based on the taxonomy of the bats indicating that Pd is a generalist pathogen that is transmitted readily across bat species . \n In this study , we isolated and characterized a novel virus , PdPV-pa , from the pathogenic filamentous fungus causing WNS in North American bats . Based on the nucleotide sequence , sequence properties at the 5' and 3' termini , genome organization , morphology of the virus particle and phylogenetic analysis , PdPV-pa was confirmed as a new member of the genus Gammapartitivirus , family Partitiviridae . PdPV-pa shows closest similarity with PsV-S within Gammapartitivirus . The branch supports of over 90% in posterior probability in the RdRp and 100% in the CP Bayesian trees separating PdPV-pa from PsV-S ( Fig 4A & 4B ) and Gammapartitivirus species delimitation criteria ( \u2264 90% aa-sequence identity in RdRp and/or \u2264 80% aa-sequence identity in CP [26] ) confirmed PdPV's taxonomic placement into a distinct species [25] . The occurrence of PdPV-pa infection in Pd isolates from diverse geographical locations and time suggests PdPV-pa is widely spread in North America . We could not rule out the possibility of PdPV-pa incidence in Europe considering the sample size of 17 isolates that we examined in this study . Previously , Warneke et al . [14] reported a Pd isolate from Germany ( MmyotGER2 ) showing similar mortality effects to North American isolates when inoculated onto North American little brown bat ( M . lucifugus ) under experimental conditions . Unfortunately , we were not able to obtain the German isolate to evaluate the presence of PdPV-pa . However the close association of PdPV-pa in a diverse subset of the North American population of Pd sampled ( 35 isolates from 7 states ) may provide some indications of the roles of PdPV-pa in WNS . Many mycoviruses have been reported to elicit phenotypic changes , including both hypovirulence and hypervirulence in their fungal hosts [18] . For example , the presence of Helminthosporium victoriae 145S virus ( chrysovirus ) in the plant pathogenic fungus , Helminthosporium victoria increased virulence in oat plants . The viral dsRNAs up-regulated Hv-p68 , an alcohol oxidase/RNA-binding protein in the fungus that is likely responsible for the disease development [27] . Similarly , a high level of virulence was reported in the presence of a six kbp mycoviral dsRNA in Nectria radicicola , the causal fungus of ginger root rot [28] . The opportunistic fungal pathogen , Aspergillus fumigatus causing lung disease in immunocompromised humans and animals also exhibited hypervirulence in the presence of the uncharacterized A78 mycovirus [29] . We have not explored the roles of PdPV-pa in WNS in the present study , but some indirect evidence , including the difficulties in curing the fungus of PdPV-pa , the stability of the virus after numerous generations of laboratory cultures , the changes in pigmentation and the significantly reduced production of conidia in the virus-free isolate indicate close biological relationships between the fungus and the virus; hence future investigation on potential biological effects of PdPV-pa will be important . In our attempts to cure PdPV-pa , PEG-induced stress on the matric potential was found effective . PEG being non-toxic and metabolically inert to fungi is an ideal compound to manipulate matric-induced water stress in media [30] . Matric potential influences water availability of substrates through capillary actions and particle adsorptive forces [31] . Raudabaugh & Miller [32] showed that Pd is sensitive to matric induced water stress beyond -5MPa , which is consistent with our results . In addition to the Pd growth response , normal growth at lower matric stress and significant growth inhibition as negative values of matric potential increases are characteristic of most soil fungi [32 , 33] . It is possible that Pd may have originated as a soil fungus and the adaptive pressure due to competition expanded its niche . The capacity of a human pathogenic fungus , Cryptococccus neoformans , to infect several animals including cats , dogs , dolphins , sheep and many birds was explained based on the environmental selective pressures imposed on it while surviving in its primary niche: soil [34] . The recent findings that Pd is capable of surviving on various substrates like harvestmen , fungus gnats , moss , and cave soils in addition to bat skin [32 , 35 , 36] , support this argument . Whether or not Pd susceptibility to matric stress is related to its origin , the inhibitory effect of the matric stress on both Pd and PdPV-pa confirms parallel biological response of both the virus and the fungus . The genetic variation in the RdRp ( <1% ) and the CP ( 2\u20133% ) of North American populations of PdPV-pa seems low , but in fact is quite high for partitiviruses . In studies with plant partitiviruses we find less than 1% divergence after extended periods of evolution ( MR , personal observation ) . This higher level of variation implies a recent introduction of PdPV-pa . According to our results , only one species of this virus appears to occur in the North American isolates of Pd . The phylogenetic analysis based on a Bayesian algorithm of CP nucleotide sequences showed geographical clustering of 45 North American isolates into two main clades: USA and Canada . This indicates the diversification of PdPV-pa isolates is the outcome of geographical separation followed by sequence variation . No bat host specialization was observed . This finding is consistence with the clonal populations of Pd reported previously [10 , 11] with only one mating type [12] despite its infection in several species of bats in North America . The phylogenetic signatures of PdPV-pa isolates relating to geography provide valuable insights on the spread of WNS . The phylogeny supports two major clusters and many sub-clusters corresponding to US States of PdPV-pa isolation , suggesting connections among North American isolates , which is valuable in tracing WNS . Additionally , clustering of Pd isolates based on location was observed in several occasions within the USA clades followed by divergence , most likely for local adaptation . This analysis can be successfully expanded incorporating CP sequences of PdPV-pa from wider geographical locations to study the spread of WNS . \n Pseudogymnoascus destructans ( Pd ) was isolated from diseased bat wing tissue , live bat wing punches ( 2-5mm diameter ) or wing swabs , cultured on 0 . 5X ( 7 . 5 g/L ) Sabouraud dextrose agar ( SDA ) plates with 20 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin , streptomycin and tetracycline at 10\u00b0 C for 3 weeks in the dark . Identification of Pd was confirmed based on the species morphological characters i . e . , the presence of curved conidia [1] and DNA sequences from conserved regions: internal transcribed spacer1 ( ITS1 ) , elongation factor 1\u03b1 ( EF-1\u03b1 ) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gdp ) genes . The pure cultures of Pd were obtained either by single spore isolation or hyphal tip cultures . For single spore cultures , actively growing Pd plates ( 100 mm X 15 mm ) of over three weeks old were flooded with 2 ml of sterile water and gently swirled to release the spores ( conidia ) . The spore suspension was vortexed for one minute to avoid clumping of spores . The spore suspension was then picked using an inoculating loop and spread over water agar plate ( 19 g/L ) . About 1 ml of sterile water was added in the process to help to spread the spores uniformly . The plate was viewed under a dissecting microscope and concentration of the spore suspension was adjusted so that each plate had 20\u201330 spores . The plate was then cultured at 7\u00b0-10\u00b0C in the dark and checked for germination every alternate day . Once the spores germinated , an agar plug was cut containing hyphae from the single germinating spore without damaging growing hyphae and then plated on a regular SDA plate to culture . For hyphal tip culture , we used the protocols described by Kanematsu et . al . [37] with some modification . We plated spore suspension on regular SDA plates as described above but when spores geminated and mycelia mats were formed they were gently overlaid with sterile Whatman cellulose filter paper soaked in SDB . The plates were then cultured for an additional two weeks until the fungal hyphae penetrated the filter paper and started growing on the upper surface . At that point the filter paper was removed and its upper surface was scraped gently and hyphal segments were suspended in sterile water . The method produced hyphal segments ranging from 4\u20138 cells in length that were appropriate for the hyphal tip culture . The hyphal segment suspension was then plated on SDA plates adjusting the concentration so that each plate had uniform distribution of 20\u201330 hyphal segments . Finally agar plugs grown from individual hyphal segments were cultured in separate plates to obtain a pure culture . The fungal isolates were stored in SDA plates for short-term storage at 4\u00b0C and at -80\u00b0C in the form of mycelia in 50% glycerol for long-term storage . All Pd isolates from Pennsylvania , one from Vermont and one from Indiana used in this study were isolated and cultured in our laboratory . The substrates ( bat wings , wing punches , swabs ) for these cultures were obtained from routine surveys of the Pennsylvania Game Commission ( http://www . pgc . pa . gov/Wildlife/Wildlife-RelatedDiseases/WhiteNoseSyndrome ) . The isolates from New York , West Virginia , North Carolina , Ohio , the remaining two isolates from Vermont and all European isolates were obtained as sub-cultures from the Center for Forest Mycology Research , United States Forest Service , Madison , WI ( http://www . fpl . fs . fed . us/research/centers/mycology/culture-collection . shtml ) . The Canadian isolates were obtained as sub-cultures from New Brunswick Museum collections , New Brunswick , Canada ( http://www . nbm-mnb . ca ) . In addition , we obtained five isolates of Geomyces sp . collected from Antarctic soil from Dr . Robert A . Blanchette\u2019s collection at the University of Minnesota and we used six isolates of Pseudogymnoascus sp . from cave soil in Pennsylvania for this study . We extracted dsRNAs from lyophilized mycelia of Pd with a minor modification in the protocol described by M\u00e1rquez et . al . [38] , specifically Pd was cultured using mycelial plugs or spores in 150 ml of 0 . 5X Sabouraud dextrose broth ( SDB ) supplemented with 20 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin , streptomycin and tetracycline in a shaker at 10\u00b0C under dark conditions for three weeks prior to lyophilization . In addition to binding to CF11 cellulose ( Whatman ) in the presence of ethanol , the chemical nature of the dsRNA was confirmed by its resistance to DNase and RNase with NaCl concentration > 0 . 3M . Approximately 2 \u03bcg of dsRNA were mixed with 2 \u03bcM of random primer-dN10 with a linker sequence ( 5'CCTTCGGATCCTCCN103' ) , 0 . 5 mM of Tris-EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 12 \u03bcl , and boiled for 2 min . The mixture was incubated on ice , and 8 \u03bcl of Reverse Transcriptase ( RT ) mix ( SuperScriptTM III RT 200U , 5X First-Strand buffer 4 \u03bcl , 0 . 1M DTT 1 \u03bcl and dNTP 0 . 5 mM as recommended by the manufacturer ) were added and incubation continued at 50\u00b0C for 1 . 5 hours . The newly synthesized cDNA mixture was then incubated with 10 \u03bcg of boiled RNase A ( Sigma ) for 15 min . at room temperature and cleaned with E . Z . N . A Cycle Pure Kit ( Omega Bio-tech ) according to the manufactures instruction . About 0 . 5 \u03bcg of cleaned cDNA was used as a template for a 25 \u03bcl polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with Taq DNA Polymerase ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , buffers , dNTPs supplied with 1\u03bcM concentration of the primer ( 5'CCTTCGGATCCTCC 3' ) . The PCR was completed in a Idaho Technologies Rapid Cycler with a slope setting of 5 , using the following cycles: 1 cycle of 94\u00b0C , 1 min . ; 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C , 0 sec . , 45\u00b0C , 0 sec . , and 72\u00b0C , 15 sec . ; 1cycle of 72\u00b0C , 5 min . ; 1 cycle of 37\u00b0C , 5 min . The PCR product was cleaned and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System ( Promega ) according to the manufacturers instructions . Sequence analysis of the cDNA plasmid clones were done by the Genomic Core Facility of Pennsylvania State University , University Park , PA . The sequences obtained were trimmed for plasmid and primer sequences and assembled using de novo assembly in Geneious version 8 . 0 . 2 [39] . All cloning and sequence analysis was based on the dsRNA from the LB-01 isolate cultured from a little brown bat from Pennsylvania . RNA ligase mediated-rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RLM-RACE ) was performed to determine the terminal sequences of the PdPV-pa dsRNA segments . A 5'-phosphorylated oligodeoxynucletide ( 5'-PO4-GGAGGATCCGAATTCAGG 3' ) was ligated to the dsRNA termini as an adaptor before synthesizing cDNAs using a complementary primer ( 5'CCTGAATTCGGATCCTCC3' ) in combination with the internal primers designed for PdPV-pa RNA1 and RNA2 ( RNA 1: 5'TTCAAGTTCGCCCTGTACC3'F , 5'TGAGCGAATGGAAGGTTG3'R; RNA 2: 5'CGCGTAATCATGACGACC3'F , 5'CCGAGGAGCACACACTATC3'R ) in RLM-RACE . Ligation reactions were done in 50% PEG with 2 U of T4 RNA ligase 2 ( New England BioLabs ) mixed with approximately 2 \u03bcg of dsRNA along with the primers mentioned above and buffer supplied according to the manufacturers instructions , and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight . RT-PCR of the primer-ligated dsRNA was performed exactly like described in the cDNA synthesis above except the enzyme used was Avian Myeloblastosis Virus ( AMV ) RT ( New England BioLabs ) . The amplicons were cloned followed by sequence determination using Sanger sequencing . The complete nucleotide sequences of PdPV-pa RNA 1 and PdPV-pa RNA 2 have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KY20754 and KY207544 , respectively . Consensus sequences for PdPV-pa RNA 1 and RNA 2 were analyzed for the open reading frames ( ORFs ) using ORF finding operation in Geneious version 8 . 0 . 2 . A sequence similarity search was conducted with BLASTn and BLASTx available online from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) . Northern blotting was performed using non-radioactive isotopes probes , digoxigenin ( DIG ) -11-dUTP-labeled DNA fragments according to the manufacturers instructions ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Representative clones of PdPV-pa RNA 1 and RNA 2 in the range of 500\u2013700 bp were selected and the labeling was done in a PCR with DIG-11-dUTP and dNTPs mix ( DIG-11-dUTP:dTTP = 1:3; with equimolar amount of dATP , dCTP and dGTP ) , Taq DNA Polymerase ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , specific primers and buffer in Idaho Technologies Rapid Cycler as described above . About 2 \u03bcg of PdPV-pa dsRNA was electrophoresed in 1 . 2% agarose gels and subsequently denatured by saturating with freshly prepared 50mM NaOH for 30 min followed by neutralization in 50mM sodium borate for 5 min . The cycle was repeated three times before dsRNA was transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond N+ Amersham ) by capillary action overnight . The membranes were UV-cross-linked in a Stratalinker at 200 J . Hybridization and washings were carried out as described by Li et al . [40] except we performed prehybridization and hybridization at 52\u00b0C instead of 42\u00b0C . The blots were incubated in antibody solution , anti-DIG-AP Conjugate ( Roche ) and CDP-STAR ( Roche ) for chemiluminescence detection . Virus particles were purified following methods described by Sanderlin and Ghabrial [41] with some modifications . Eight g of lyophilized mycelia of Pd isolate BB-06 was ground to powder in the presence of liquid nitrogen . The homogenates were mixed with extraction buffer ( 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate . pH 7 . 6 containing 0 . 5% ( v/v ) thioglycolic acid ) and mixed with chloroform followed by low speed centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . The virus containing supernatant was then subjected to two cycles of differential centrifugations ( low speed at 7000 rpm for 15 min and ultracentrifuge at 35 , 000 for 1 . 5 hours ) . During the ultracentrifuge cycle , the virus containing supernatant was underlaid with a 10% sucrose cushion . The final pellets were suspended in 1 ml of 0 . 03 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7 . 6 . The virus preparation was examined under JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope after negatively staining with uranyl formate in the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at Penn State College of Medicine , Hersey , PA . For the heat stress , actively growing Pd plates in three replicates were exposed to room temperature ( 22\u201323\u00b0C ) , 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C for 2 , 6 , 12 and 24 hours before culturing the mycelia plugs from each treatments in liquid medium ( SDB ) under normal laboratory culture conditions for Pd described above . During the treatments , Pd plates in three replicates were also grown under normal culture condition as controls . The fungal mycelia were then harvested after three weeks to extract dsRNAs . However , only samples treated at room temperature and 37\u00b0C for 2 hours grew . Single spore isolation and hyphal tip cultures were done as described under the section , fungal isolation and culture . The protoplast isolation from Pd was performed on mycelia ( ~ 1 . 7 g ) harvested from SDB culture after two weeks at 10\u00b0C in a shaker ( 200 rpm ) in the dark . The fungal mycelia were collected by centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for 5 min followed by washing with KCl buffer ( 0 . 6 M , pH 5 . 8 ) as an osmotic stabilizing agent . The mycelia was treated with lysing enzyme mixture ( Lysing enzyme from Trichoderma harzianum 20 mg/ml and driselase 20 mg/ml from Sigma ) prepared in KCl buffer and incubated at 10\u00b0C at 70 rpm in the dark . Protoplast production was checked every half an hour until 35\u201340 protoplasts were observed under a 40X field with 10 \u03bcl of the mixture . The mixture was then passed through double-layered miracloth ( VWR ) soaked in STC buffer ( 1 . 2 M Sorbitol; 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5; 20 mM CaCl2 ) to filter out the cell debris . The filtrate was centrifuged at 90 \u00d7 g for 5 min to collect the protoplasts which were resuspended in regeneration media ( 0 . 5% yeast extract , 2% glucose , 0 . 6 M Sorbitol and 25 mM CaCl2 ) followed by incubation at 10\u00b0C at 70 rpm in the dark . Once the protoplasts recovered completely with cell wall growth , they were transferred to agar supplemented regeneration media ( 0 . 5% yeast extract , 2% glucose , 20% sucrose and 1% agar ) and the concentration adjusted so that each plate had 25\u201330 uniformly distributed cells . The plates were then incubated under normal culture condition for Pd until hyphae developed uniformly around each protoplast without touching each other . Individual colonies were then picked and cultured in SDA . We also treated Pd with the antiviral drugs cycloheximide and ribavirin at different concentrations in SDA media . Cycloheximide was used at 2 \u03bcg/ml , 5 \u03bcg/ml , 10 \u03bcg/ml , 15 \u03bcg/ml and 25 \u03bcg/ml concentrations . Ribavirin treatment was at 80 \u03bcM , 100 \u03bcM , 150 \u03bcM , 200 \u03bcM and 300 \u03bcM concentrations . Three passages with both cycloheximide and ribavirin were also performed with higher concentrations . For PEG induced matric stress on water availability we used PEG 8000 ( Fisher BioRegents ) in a modified Spezieller N\u00e4hrstoffarmer liquid media ( SN: 0 . 02 g sucrose , 0 . 02 g glucose , 0 . 08 g KNo3 , 0 . 08 g KH2Po4 , 0 . 04 g MgSo4 . 7H2O and 0 . 04 g NaCl/L ) to make media with water potential gradients of -1 MPa , -2 MPa , -3MPa , -4 MPa , -5 MPa and -6 MPa . The amount of PEG 8000 in gram/gram of water was calculated based on Michel [42] equation: \u03a8 ( water potential ) = 1 . 29 [PEG]2T \u2013 140[PEG]2\u20134 [PEG] and the value was adjusted to the Pd culture temperature of 10\u00b0C . An agar plug containing actively growing Pd was placed in 50 ml autoclaved modified SN liquid media with a targeted amount of PEG 8000 ( -1 MPa: ~ 0 . 075 PEG g/g of water , -2 MPa: ~ 0 . 11 PEG g/g of water , -3 MPa: ~ 0 . 14 PEG g/g of water , -4 MPa: ~ 0 . 16 PEG g/g of water , -5 MPa: ~ 0 . 19 PEG g/g of water and -6 MPa: ~ 0 . 21 PEG g/g of water ) and grown as described above . After three weeks , pieces of newly growing mycelia of Pd were transferred to normal SBD routinely used to culture Pd and the fungus was harvested after a normal culture period . The fungi from different treatments were examined for PdPV-pa both by dsRNAs gel electrophoresis and RT-PCR with PdPV-pa specific primers . In all methods Pd isolate LB-01 was used . Genetic variation in North American PdPV-pa isolates were determined by sequence analysis of RdRp and CP segments amplified in RT-PCR using specific primers . The primer pairs specific to RdRp ( 5'ATGGAAGTATCTCCTTTCG3'F , 5'GTATAGAAGATTGAGTGCC3' R ) and CP ( 5'ACTCTGTGTTAACGGAGG3'F , 5'CTGTAGTTGACACCTGTACC3'R ) were designed from the consensus sequences of RNA 1 and RNA 2 assembled from LB-01 isolate cloned sequences . PCR products using RdRp and CP specific primers from 45 North American PdPV isolates were sequenced and aligned with MUSCLE default settings in the program Geneious 8 . 0 [39] . The RdRp sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY207498 to KY207552 and the CP sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY207453 to KY207497 . The alignment was visually corrected as necessary before recording segregating and singleton sites . The average percentage identity for each sequence was calculated by taking the average from a pairwise percentage identity matrix generated from the sequence alignment . Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MrBayes [43] implemented via a plug-in in Geneious . The amino acid sequences were used in studying the evolutionary relationships of PdPV-pa within the genus Gammapartitivirus . The tree was constructed using amino acid sequence ( RdRp and CP ) of 10 approved species of Gammapartitivirus available in the GenBank . The sequences of Pepper cryptic virus 1 , type member of genus Deltapartitivirus , which is the closest group to Gammapartitivirus in Partitiviridae family was used as outgroup . We used nucleotide sequences ( CP ) to study phylogenetic relationships of PdPV-pa in North American population . The nucleotide sequence of PsV-S CP was used as outgroup in the analysis . In Bayesian trees construction using amino acid sequence of the RdRp and CP ORFs , Jukes-Cantor substitution model was applied and for nucleotide sequences of CP General time-reversible ( GTR ) model with gamma rate variation was used based on the best model tested out of 28 models ."}
